# PyRevisor
This is a script intended to help with exam revision. While studying, take notes in a text file. Make sure that your notes span two lines (Example in the readme). Once you have finished taking notes, run the script with the text file, and the script will quiz you on your notes in a random order. Once done, it will give you your score, as well as generate a PDF with all the questions and answers, and how you did
